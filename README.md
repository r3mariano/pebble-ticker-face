The Ticker pebble watchface source code is available here under a permissive licence. See the watchface [here](http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5584c6136b9455aa0400005f).

The watchface code is heavily based on tutorial code, but can hopefully be a good starting point for others to implement similar functionality.

The config js and html is provided, but to use a modified version in production you will need to host the files on a public web server.
